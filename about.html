                <h1>A little about me...</h1>
                <p>I started in Eugene's wonderful culinary realm a little over 6 years ago. 
                    I started as a dishwaher and worked my way up. I love cooking. I love food, and I love Eugene. 
                    There are so many wonderful places here to eat. I have been lucky enough to work at a few gems and grow and learn in the process.
                    Its hard to pin point my favorite things to cook, so I have went back through my photos and chose some of my favorites that I have made.
                    Most are from work but there are a few that I have thrown in that I made at home.
                    The culinary field has truly saved me and taught me so much. I will always have a special place in my heart for the food that 
                    moulded my soul.
